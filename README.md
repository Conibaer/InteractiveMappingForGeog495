# Lab 4: Interactive Web Mapping - Vaccine Rates By County 

**Author:** Chase Barrows

**Content:** This is a choropleth map of all Washington state Counties and their respective vaccination rates per 10k persons. The data is from the New York Times and reflects the most recent data as of 10/25/2021. The bins to distinguish between color schemes for different rates were selected by hand in order to highlight different levels of variation and larger statewide patterns. This results in different binning sizes, as seen in the legend key, and should be acknowledged by the viewer as so.
